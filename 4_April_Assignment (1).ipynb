    "Decision tree classification aims to minimize impurity or entropy at each node, ensuring effective data partitioning. At each step, it selects the feature that maximally reduces entropy or impurity when splitting the data. Entropy measures randomness, while impurity measures misclassification. By iteratively selecting features and splitting data, the algorithm forms a tree where each branch represents a decision based on feature thresholds. The process continues recursively until a stopping criterion, such as a minimum node size or maximum tree depth, is met. Ultimately, the decision tree predicts the class label by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node based on input features."

Each split forms a boundary, segmenting the space into regions corresponding to different class labels. Predictions occur by locating the region in which a data point falls, assigning it the majority class label of that region. Decision boundaries are orthogonal to feature axes, simplifying interpretation and prediction."

Different metrics prioritize different aspects like accuracy, precision, or recall, depending on the problem's goals and class imbalance.

For instance, in medical diagnosis, where false negatives are costly, prioritizing recall might be more appropriate, while in spam detection, precision could be prioritized to reduce false positives."
